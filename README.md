# Enhancing Event Timelines through the Integration of Coreference Resolution, Single Mention Detection and NER : A Case Study of World War II

## Abstract
Our project tackles the challenge of analyzing and organizing a vast amount of unstructured text data related to World War II in a temporal manner. Traditional data processing techniques are not efficient in handling such large amounts of data, and manual analysis is not feasible due to the immense size of the dataset. 

To overcome these challenges, we use natural language processing (NLP) techniques, specifically coreference resolution, word embeddings, and single-mention detection. By implementing these techniques, we identify and link related events, people, and places mentioned in the texts and arrange them chronologically to create a comprehensive timeline of events during the war. 

This approach provides valuable insights into the history of the war and its impact over time, leading to discoveries and a deeper understanding of the events. Moreover, the methodology can be applied to other historical and non-historical domains, providing a framework for analyzing historical events and trends in a systematic and comprehensive manner using NLP techniques. 

Overall, our project leverages NLP to solve the challenge of analyzing unstructured text data related to World War II and contributes to historical research in a significant way. By providing a more efficient and comprehensive approach, we revolutionize historical research and analysis, ultimately leading to a better understanding of the past and its impact on the present.
